A robotic Tossing Arm - Capstone Project at RMIT Vietnam

Robot control and then especially robot motion control, is one of the most important key competences for the development of industrial robotics. By applying and developing advanced control, it is possible to continuously improve the robot and process performance, which is necessary in order to increase performance and lower cost of industrial robot automation. 

The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of replacing traditional pick and place robotic operations with throwing operation. Throwing has the potential to increase the physical reachability and picking speed of a robotic apparatus. However, precisely throwing arbitrary objects presents many challenges such as handling varying object-centric properties (e.g., mass distribution, friction, shape) and complex aerodynamics. 

This project will utilize computer vision,machine learning algorithms and ROS (Robotic Operating System) to overcome these challenges successfully and to make the system much cost effective, flexible and adaptable. It is designed in modular blocks which can be integrated and substituted with existing infrastructure in an industrial warehouse with minimum downtime and capital investment. Overall our solution will make the whole finished and semi-finished good transportation process inside a warehouse more efficient and cost effective.
